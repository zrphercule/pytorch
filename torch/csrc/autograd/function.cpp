/*
 * Fix for #5534: prevent stack overflow on deletion of deep computation graph
 *
 * Sometimes one can end up with a very big computation graph of Functions
 * and Edges. Each std::shared_ptr<Function> contains a list of Edge, and
 * each Edge contains a std::shared_ptr<Function>. Deleting a
 * std::shared_ptr<Function> can trigger the recursive deletion of other
 * std::shared_ptr<Function>'s: this can stack overflow if the graph
 * is deep enough. Here is an example of such a graph:
 *
 * shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> ... -> shared_ptr<Function>
 *
 * The solution here is to use a custom deleter with each
 * std::shared_ptr<Function>. The custom deleter keeps track of how many
 * nested deleters it is in. When this number exceeds the maximum allowed
 * depth, the Function* to be deleted are accumulated in a per-thread
 * delete queue and handled by one of the deleters.
 *
 * Note that these custom deleters are NOT necessary for deleting PyFunction.
 * This is because a THPFunction Python object owns a PyFunction that is in a
 * computation graph. When Python objects get recursively destroyed, they
 * are also queued into a delete list. This happens very early for them
 * (at 50 deleters): https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f320be77ffb73e3b9e7fc98c37b8df3975d84b40/Include/object.h#L1024-L1063
 * so we don't need to worry about them.

/*
 * If this number is set too high, a deep computation graph can still
 * stack overflow. The procedure for setting this number was to
 * 1) find the smallest value that would not guard against stack overflows
 *    on various machines
 * 2) Take the minimum of all such values and subtract some leeway because
 *    the memory of these stack frames will probably grow as time passes.
 * Testing on a few machines machines, the magic numbers were:
 * - Mac OSX (Macbook Pro 15) : ~60000
 * - A beefy Ubuntu 16.04 box : ~15000
 * - Windows AWS instance (g3.4xlarge): variable. My two attempts at different
 *   times have gotten the following numbers: ~8300, 3669
